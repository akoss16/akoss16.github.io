       <h3>Welcome!</h3>
       <p>
Born in San Francisco, and for most of my life a resident, I’ve lived in the Mission Dolores and Russian Hill areas, and for the last 30 years on Bernal Heights. It’s a sunny neighborhood with many micro-climates, and from its top, Bernal Heights hosts, in my opinion, the best views in the City. I invite you to take a tour with me as I tell you about my neighborhood.
        </p>
    
        <p>
We’ll review a little history and visually explore what makes this neighborhood so unique.

        <h4>But first, Where is Bernal Heights?</h4>
        
        <p><span class="right-text">
Bernal Heights is south of San Francisco's Mission District, with its most prominent feature being the large rocky hill, Bernal Heights Summit, which is visible from many parts of the City. Bernal is bounded by Cesar Chavez Street (formerly Army Street) to the north, San Jose Avenue to the west, US 101 (Bayshore Blvd) to the east, and I-280 (Alemany Blvd) to the south.
