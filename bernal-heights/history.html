       <h3>History</h3>
       <p>
Bernal Heights gets its name from Jose Cornelio Bernal who, in 1839, received a land grant from the Mexican government that made up 20 percent of San Francisco. His home was built on the site  that St. Luke's Hospital now occupies.

        <p>
        In the second half of the 19th century, Bernal Heights was largely rural cow pasture. With the arrival the railroad and horsecar line in the 1860s, Bernal was linked to the rest of the city ad began to grow. But growth really took off after the 1906 earthquake, with 600 houses built the year after. Bernal now is home to more than 22,000 residents.</p>
